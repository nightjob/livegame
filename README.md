# Game Rules

`Game logic dictates a character's damage and is calculated using this algorithm:`

- If character has an activePet, we take the activePet's damage as starting value, and add it to the character's magic damage.
- If character is casting a spell, we take the spell's damage and add it to the character's magic damage.
- If a character has neither an activePet, nor a spell, we take their weapon's damage, and add it to the character's attack damage.

All classes start at level 1
These are the base requirements and stats for each character:

*Name
*Class Name
*Level
*Attack
*Magic
*Defense
*Speed
*Health
*Mana

The following are optional for characters:

*Spells
*Weapons
*Pets

In the game, 10 is a very strong stat, the max to start with. 1 is the lowest. These are the boundaries that will be defined.

Health and mana are diffrent. They have no bounds.
